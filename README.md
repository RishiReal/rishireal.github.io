# hi i'm rishi
I grew up in Brookfield, CT but I'll be moving to Ithaca, NY to further my education at Cornell where I'll study Computer Science and Statistics at the College of Arts and Sciences. Outside of school, I really enjoy lifting, and I also like playing tennis, soccer, and ping pong. I've competed in [powerlifting](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0B3J8VgiBo/) in the past and in the future, I plan on competing in a few table tennis tournaments. In all honesty, I have no idea what the future holds for my career or interests, but I'm confident that whatever I do, it will be something I truly enjoy doing.

For now, I'm here to help you get into college :D. I found the process challenging myself, so I understand how overwhelming it can be. My goal is to assist you with whatever you need, from essays and interviews to tips and tricks to help you get into the college you desire at a low cost.
